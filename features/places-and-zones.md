# Feature: Places & zones

**Phase:** 2  
**Status:** Implemented in app — requires Supabase migrations 002 (+ seed 003)  
**Code:** `apps/web/src/features/places/`  
**Gate:** `docs/board/PRE-PHASE-2-GATE.md`

## Goal

Cities, layover zones, places, and dishes — without crew hotel identity. Manual create + public browse.

## Acceptance criteria (this cut)

- [x] City list + city page by slug
- [x] Zones per city (`airport_strip`, `downtown`, `station`, `other`)
- [x] CRUD for places (auth write); public read of published content
- [x] Dishes linked to places (simple child on create)
- [x] No public “hotel name” field on place forms
- [x] Zone optional but encouraged for logistics tips
- [x] RLS: public read published; auth write own; admin all (policies in 002)

## Out of scope (Phase 2)

- Separate **Activity** entity/table
- **Events** entity
- Social, AI import, Stripe, sponsor placements
- Crew-only / hotel-level fields

## Security

Follow `docs/SECURITY.md`. Public copy uses zones and landmarks only.
